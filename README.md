# MSc Dissertation: Explaining Molecular Smell with Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for my MSc dissertation in Data Science and AI, titled "Explaining Molecular Smell with Deep Learning." The project focuses on utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict odors based on molecular and spectral data.

## Files
- `CNN model - spectral data.py`: Python script implementing the CNN model for spectral data processing.
- `CONCATENATED MODEL.py`: Python script implementing the concatenated model combining GNN and CNN outputs.
- `GNN model - structural data.py`: Python script implementing the GNN model for structural data processing.
- `Explaining_molecular_smell_with_deep_learning_Dissertation.pdf`: PDF document containing the dissertation report.
- `visualisation.py`: Python script for data visualization and analysis.
